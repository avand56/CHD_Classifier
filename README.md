# CHD_Classifier
Neural networks and logistic regression to predictwhether a patient went on to develop Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or not.

A logistic regression model is created to do so, followed by a linear artificial neural network and a nonlinear artificial neural network. The logistic regression model worked best, likely because the neural networks needed more deep layers to capture the data's nonlinearity.
